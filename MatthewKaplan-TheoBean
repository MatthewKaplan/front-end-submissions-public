 # Code Quality

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub (from either repository) that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/MatthewKaplan/ColorConstructor/blob/master/src/components/PaletteMaker/PaletteMaker.js)

 * Why were you proud of this piece of code?  
- We had to put a lot of thought into this file especially where we did all of the conditional rendering.

 #### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/MatthewKaplan/ColorConstructor/blob/master/src/components/PaletteMaker/PaletteMaker.js)

 * Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?
- This one componenet is over 400 lines long and this is because we had to do a lot of conditional rendering and had to play around with state and props because we decided not to use redux. I think some of this code can be refactored in the return but we didnt want to break anything last minute. 

 #### Link to Design Inspiration

 * Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it  
[design inspiration](https://colorsupplyyy.com/app/)

- We really liked the idea of displaying saved palettes on a pie chart.

 #### Reflection on New Concepts

 * Describe your thoughts on server-side testing  
- Such a pain to setup but painless after we got rolling. 
* Describe your thoughts on TravisCI  
- I hope to never have to use it again. After numerous attempts to get our project deployed on travisCI it broke after we updated the readme.
* Describe your thoughts in creating a single project whose codebase was distributed across multiple repositories
- I enjoyed it especially because it was a paired project and we could both focus on one end at a time and not step on eachothers toes.
